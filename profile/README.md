## What Do Epoxy Contractors Do?

Epoxy contractors are trained professionals who apply epoxy coatings to concrete floors, creating a seamless, glossy surface that resists damage from chemicals, moisture, and heavy traffic. The process involves cleaning and preparing the surface, applying a primer, and layering high-quality epoxy resins for a finish that's both functional and visually appealing.
